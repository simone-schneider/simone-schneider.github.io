**Teaching**

I have extensive experience designing and delivering methodological and substantive modules from the undergraduate to PhD level. 

At the University of Cambridge, I teach [Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis](https://www.researchmethods.group.cam.ac.uk/modules/critical-approaches-to-discourse-analysis-lt/) for Master and PhD students, as well as Introduction to Sociology and Qualitative Research Methods for undergraduate students. 

In 2025, I am co-leading a course on [Sex, Power and Gender](https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/international-programmes/pembroke-cambridge-summer-programme/course-portfolio/sex-power-and-gender) in the [Pembroke Cambridge Summer Programme](https://www.pem.cam.ac.uk/international-programmes/pembroke-cambridge-summer-programme). 

Previously, I taught Qualitative Research Methods and Academic Skills for undergraduate students at the University of Amsterdam.
