**Teaching**


I teach Critical Approaches to Discourse Analysis for Master and PhD students at the University of Cambridge (2023-present). I also supervise undergraduate students in Introduction to Sociology and teach a Qualitative Research Methods seminar. In 2025, I co-lead a course on Sex, Power and Gender within the Pembroke Cambridge Summer Programme. Previously, I taught Qualitative Research and Academic Skills for undergraduate students at the University of Amsterdam.
