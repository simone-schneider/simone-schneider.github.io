Hi! I'm a doctoral researcher in the Department of Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/simone-schneider-2022), where I co-lead the [Gender & Sexuality Research Cluster](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/gender-sexuality-research-cluster). I'm a member of the [Ethical Dating Online network](https://www.ethicaldatingonline.com). My research interests span intimacy, digital technologies, social inequality, and cultural sociology. I will be on the academic job market in autumn of 2025. 

In my dissertation, I study meanings and practices of infidelity in intimate relationships. As part of this project, I conduct qualitative interviews with people who experienced infidelity, and a discourse analysis of dating platforms geared at infidelity. Through the lens of infidelity, I engage with wider questions around social norms, digital technologies, and inequality. You can find out more about my work in a recent [episode of the ePODstemology podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5a1NqXbLalwLlqgXX4jhrA?si=378c2a0d7c7e4e22) for which I was interviewed.
