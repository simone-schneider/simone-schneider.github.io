Hi! I'm a doctoral researcher in the Department of Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/simone-schneider-2022), and co-convenor of Cambridge's [Gender & Sexuality Research Cluster](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/gender-sexuality-research-cluster). My research interests span intimacy, sexuality, social inequality, and cultural sociology.

In my dissertation, I study meanings and experiences of infidelity in intimate relationships. As part of this project, I conduct qualitative interviews with people who experienced infidelity, and a discourse analysis of dating platforms geared at infidelity. Through the lens of infidelity, I engage with wider questions around social norms, morality, and inequality.
