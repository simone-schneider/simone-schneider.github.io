Simone Schneider is a doctoral researcher in the Department of Sociology at the [University of Cambridge](https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/simone-schneider-2022). Her research interests span the areas of intimacy, sexuality, social inequality, and social theory.

In her dissertation project, Simone explores meanings and experiences of infidelity in intimate relationships. As part of this project, she is conducting qualitative interviews with people who experienced infidelity themselves, as well as a discourse analysis of dating platforms geared at infidelity. Through the lens of infidelity, Simone is engaging with wider questions around social norms, morality, and inequality.

Simone studied Sociology, European Ethnology and Cultural Analysis, and Communication Science at the University of Cambridge (MPhil), the University of Amsterdam (MSc), and the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (BA, BA). Alongside her academic training, Simone gained experience in social research, including working for the Scottish Government, the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy, and the Amsterdam Research Centre for Gender and Sexuality.
